Primer on Transformation matrices
=================================

* Geometric transforms
    - Function from Points to Points
    - Lots of options, but very general, and can be expensive

    Make a gif of warping a uniform grid as example of general geometric transform

* Transformations as matrices
    - Points as vectors
    - Transformations as matrix-vector muliplcation
    - Linear transformations
    - Super useful - rotations and scalings
        - Include gifs as examples
    - Limited, all linear transformations leave (0,0) unchanged

* Homogenous Coordinates and Affine transformations
    - Need matrix mult AND addition of additional vector
    - Introduce homogenous coordinates
    - Now do Linear transformation + translations
    - Do linear style transformations with different fixed point
    - Leaves parallel lines parallel
